## Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Stockfish chess engine** installed on your system
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installing Stockfish

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stockfish
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install stockfish
```

#### Windows:
Download from [Stockfish official website](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chessgpt
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Stockfish path:**
Edit `polyglot.ini` and update the `EngineCommand` path to your Stockfish installation:
```ini
[PolyGlot]
EngineCommand = /path/to/your/stockfish
```

Common paths:
- Ubuntu/Debian: `/usr/bin/stockfish`
- macOS (Homebrew): `/opt/homebrew/bin/stockfish`
- Windows: `C:\path\to\stockfish.exe`

## Running the Application

The application consists of three components that need to be running simultaneously:

### 1. Start the WebSocket Server
```bash
node server.js
```
This starts the WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8080`

### 2. Start the Chess Analysis Service
```bash
node index.js
```
This connects Stockfish to the WebSocket server for real-time analysis

### 3. Start the React Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
This starts the web application on `http://localhost:9000`

### Quick Start Script
For convenience, you can run all services in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
node server.js
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
node index.js
```

**Terminal 3:**
```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`

## Usage

### Basic Chess Playing
1. **Make moves**: Click and drag pieces on the board
2. **View analysis**: Real-time engine evaluation appears on the right
3. **Undo moves**: Use the "Undo Move" button
4. **Auto-analysis**: Toggle the checkbox to enable/disable automatic analysis

### Loading Games
1. **PGN Input**: Paste PGN notation in the text area
2. **Load PGN**: Click "Load PGN" to import the game
3. **Navigate**: Use undo to step through the loaded game

### Analysis Control
- **Auto-analyze moves**: Check/uncheck to control automatic analysis
- **Manual control**: When auto-analysis is off, analysis won't run on moves
- **Real-time updates**: Analysis updates continuously when enabled

## Architecture

### Frontend (React/Redux)
- **React Components**: Modular UI components for board, moves, and analysis
- **Redux Store**: Centralized state management for game and analysis
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time communication with analysis engine

### Backend Services
- **WebSocket Server**: Message broker between frontend and engine
- **Analysis Service**: Stockfish integration via PolyGlot adapter
- **Chess Engine**: Stockfish providing position evaluation

### Data Flow
1. User makes move on board → Redux updates game state
2. If auto-analysis enabled → WebSocket sends position to engine
3. Stockfish analyzes → Returns evaluation via WebSocket
4. Frontend receives analysis → Updates UI in real-time

## Configuration

### Engine Settings
Edit `polyglot.ini` to customize Stockfish behavior:

```ini
[PolyGlot]
EngineCommand = /path/to/stockfish
Book = true
BookFile = Titans.bin

[Engine]
Threads = 16           # CPU threads for analysis
Hash = 512            # Memory allocation (MB)
MultiPV = 3           # Number of analysis lines
Skill Level = 20      # Engine strength (0-20)
```

### Development Settings
- **Port Configuration**: WebSocket server runs on port 8080
- **Dev Server**: React app runs on port 9000
- **Hot Reloading**: Enabled in development mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"WebSocket connection failed"**
- Ensure `node server.js` is running
- Check port 8080 is not blocked by firewall

**"No analysis appearing"**
- Verify `node index.js` is running
- Check Stockfish path in `polyglot.ini`
- Ensure auto-analysis checkbox is enabled

**"Moves not working"**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all three services are running
- Try refreshing the page

**"PGN won't load"**
- Ensure PGN format is correct
- Check for special characters or encoding issues

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging by opening browser DevTools (F12) to see:
- WebSocket connection status
- Move validation messages
- Analysis data flow
